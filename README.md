# Balanced Bot with CartPole-DQN 🤸🤖

Hello and welcome! Dive into the world of reinforcement learning with the `CartPole-DQN` repository. Here, we've built an AI agent capable of mastering the classic CartPole game from OpenAI Gym. Harnessing deep learning, our bot perfects the art of balancing. 🌌

## 🗂 Repository Contents

1. **main.py**: This file is the crux of our project, featuring a DQN algorithm. It brings together deep neural networking, apt decision-making between exploration and exploitation, and Q-value optimizations. 🌐
   
2. **catrpole-policyNN**: The culmination of training is saved here. This model is a testament to the agent's learning journey and can be deployed for inferences instantly. 📘
   
3. **test_model_rendered.ipynb**: The stage is set in this Jupyter notebook. Witness our AI prodigy keeping that pole balanced with grace! 🎥

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Training Mode**:
   - To commence training, execute the `main.py` script. Whenever the agent sets a new record in pole balancing, the model is preserved.
     ```shell
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Showtime**:
   - Navigate to `test_model_rendered.ipynb` in Jupyter. With the trained model nearby, run the notebook cells and bask in the brilliance of the trained agent.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Gym
- TensorFlow

Kickstart by installing the essential packages:
```shell
pip install gym tensorflow
```
## 🥂 Wrapping Up

It's astounding how Deep Reinforcement Learning turns a challenging CartPole game into child's play. This model learns, adapts, and dazzles. Explore, interact, and enjoy the balancing spectacle! 🎩🚀🥳
